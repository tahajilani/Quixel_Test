# Quixel_Test
Tasks Completed

-> Write dataloader for data

-> Write Variational Autoencoder

-> The encoder is trainable. The outputs are however are infinitesimally and this I was unable to do inference. Maybe need to improve model.

-> https://towardsdatascience.com/teaching-a-variational-autoencoder-vae-to-draw-mnist-characters-978675c95776 was used for VAE understanding and as a template.

-> I couldn't really experiment much with model since locally it was running very slow and google colab had taken my gpu access.
